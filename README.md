Kyle Hotchkiss' Heartfiles
==========================

Not only a `dotfiles` package, this includes some server configuration files 
that I'ved labored myself over and take great pride in. I have been playing
with server configuration files for a year or two and find I don't need most
of the fluff they are configured by default. I also like playing with 
terminal files to make the terminal more fun. Yeah, seriously!

Here's what I got:

- terminal
	- .bash_profile
	- .dir_colors
	- .gitconifg
- webservers
	- apache
	-lighttpd.conf
